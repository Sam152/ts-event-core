ts-event-core
====

This project is a reference implementation of event sourcing implemented in TypeScript
using a functional programming style.

It contains a set of loosely coupled types which show how the core components of an event
sourced system might fit together and various implementations of each type. Provided
these types can be satisfied, components can be swapped and interchanged.
