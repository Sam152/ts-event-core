    ====
    
    This project is a reference implementation for the event sourcing design pattern
    implemented in TypeScript using a functional programming style.
    
    It contains a series of loosely coupled types which show how the core of an event
    sourced system might fit together and various implementations of each type. Provided
    these types can be satisfied, components can be swapped and interchanged.
